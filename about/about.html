    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p> We are a team consists of 3 rookies, Chien-Yi (Angela) Chou, Regina Lee, and Brian Lee. Some of us are taking first year computer science class at Bronx High School of Science and some of us never had any experience with coding. Today was our first Hackathon we've ever attended. Although that's the case, we really enjoyed coming to Bronx Science Atomhacks II and we finished within the time given.
      This webpage that you are currently viewing is what we made during the hackathon. We were inspired by our school's current webpage, however, we made a new webpage from scratch to simply bxscience.edu. By doing so, students can use this webpage to have easy access to teams, clubs, schedules, and transportation. </p>
